We believe, everyone deserves to learn from the world's greatest teachers.

Cato is an effort to enable the same. We are on a mission to build the future of education. Where people learn important skills that schools don't teach, have fun while learning them, and strive to be the best versions of themselves.

Cato helps you do that by

1. Curating the best 0.1% of the knowledge from the best teachers and leaders that has 90% of the value on the internet

2. Reducing your social media distractions and spend that time on more meaningful pursuits (coming soon)

3. Helping you implement and practice the skills you are learning and give you instant feedback through fun games and assignments (coming soon)

4. Getting mentorship and network with like minded people to keep you accountable (coming soon)

5. Getting certificates for the skills you learn and leverage them to level up in your career (coming soon)

We have watched 1000s of videos on topics like Career, Social Interaction, Health and Nutrition, Intellectual Advancement, Emotional well-being, and Productivity, handpicked the best ones for you, categorized them, and arranged them in a way such that you will get the most out of your time.

We are currently in closed beta (invite only) and plan to roll out many exciting features to make learning fun for you. We are excited to have you try out the beta and give us feedback and suggestions on how we can improve.

Feel free to suggest topics you'd like us to cover next. If you are interested in contributing to our mission, please feel free to write to us at rise@cato.tv
